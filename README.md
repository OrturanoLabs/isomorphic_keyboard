# isomorphic_keyboard
Open-source modular isomorphic keyboard project

This repository contains the complete design of a modular isomorphic keyboard, built from repeatable tiles that can be arranged into different isomorphic or alternative layouts. The project includes documentation, hardware design in KiCad (schematics, PCB, and libraries), and microcontroller firmware (matrix scanning, module handling, keymapping, and communication).

The goal is to create a flexible, extensible, and reproducible platform for experimenting with non-traditional keyboard layouts and modular input devices.
